abstract = {A program for a high-speed digital electronic computer is described for performing the computation of the Munsell renotations H, V, C corresponding to given CIE chromaticity coordinates x, y and daylight reflectance Y. Mathematically, this is equivalent to a three-dimensional coordinate transformation where two of the three transformation functions are given only numerically for a grid of discrete points. Since this grid consists of approximately 5000 points which are nonuniformly spaced, the major problem was to devise an economic scanning routine in order to find the point used in the interpolation. This was accomplished by consistent use of vector algebra and the help of an interpretive routine for vector operations.}

All three dimensions have been carefully reviewed and extensively revised. The newly defined loci of constant hue have been extended closer to the extremes of value while the loci of constant chroma have been extrapolated to the pigment maximum. The dimension of value has been redefined without substantial departure from the Munsell-Sloan-Godlove scale. By the above changes a solid is achieved which approaches more closely to A. H. Munsell's dual ideal of psychological equispacing and precise applicability. The new solid is defined in terms of the I.C.I. standard coordinate system and Illuminant C.},

abstract = {The development of the Inter-Society Color Council-National Bureau of Standards (ISCC-NBS) system of color names, based on the standards in the Munsell Book of Color, made it necessary to specify the master standards of this book in fundamental terms. Accordingly, spectral reflection curves were run for each of the 421 master standards on the General Electric recording spectrophotometer at the National Bureau of Standards, using slit widths of approximately 4 millimicrons. Various corrections were applied to these spectrophotometric data in accordance with methods regularly used for such work at the bureau. Colorimetric computations were then made with these data, resulting in tristimulus specifications according to the 1931 ICI standard observer and coordinate system. Four illuminants were used: ICI Illuminants A and C, representative of incandescent-lamp light and average daylight, respectively, Illuminant D (lightly overcast north sky), and Illuminant S (extremely blue sky). The colorimetric specifications of the Munsell standards for all four illuminants are thus given. The trilinear coordinates for the Munsell standards calculated for ICI Illuminant C have been plotted on large chromaticity (x, y) diagrams and constant Munsell chroma lines drawn in. (Similar values obtained by Glenn and Killian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1935 for Munsell color standards bearing the same hue-value-chroma designations have also been plotted on the diagram and differences between the two sets of data are discussed.) These diagrams serve as means for determining the Munsell notation and thereby the ISCC-NBS color name for any color whose trilinear coordinates and apparent reflectance are given.},

This article presents open‐source computer code, running in Matlab or Octave, that both interpolates and inverts the Munsell renotation automatically. The steps in both algorithms are described in detail. Like previous inversion algorithms, it relies on interpolations between entries in the 1943 table. For colours near the MacAdam limits, the inversion also requires extrapolations beyond the 1943 entries. The outputs of the current implementation do not differ significantly from the outputs of other inversion algorithms. The main distinguishing feature of the current algorithm is that both the algorithm and code implementation are publicly available. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Col Res Appl, 2011;}
