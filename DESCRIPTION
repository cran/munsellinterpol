Description: Methods for interpolating data in the Munsell color system following the ASTM D-1535 standard. Hues and chromas with decimal values can be interpolated and converted to/from the Munsell color system and CIE xyY, CIE XYZ, CIE Lab, CIE Luv, or RGB.  Includes ISCC-NBS color block lookup.  Based on the work by Paul Centore, "The Munsell and Kubelka-Munk Toolbox".
